# regexExplained

Briefing on what the regex does and how it works.

## Summary

Going to review the core components of regex, explaining how each of them work with code snippets. The regex ^(ABC|DEF){2,3}[0-9]{1,4}$ will be used as a reference to explain the various components.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are special characters used in regex to specify the position of the match. The ^ anchor specifies the start of a string, while the $ anchor specifies the end of a string. In our reference regex `^(ABC|DEF){2,3}[0-9]{1,4}$`, the `^` and `$` ensure that the pattern matches the entire string.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of a character or a group of characters. `{n,m}` is a quantifier that matches at least `n` and at most `m` occurrences. In our reference regex, `{2,3}` and `{1,4}` are quantifiers.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs are used to define sub-patterns within a regex. They are enclosed in parentheses `()`. In our reference regex, `(ABC|DEF)` is a grouping construct which matches either ABC or DEF.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions [] are used to match any one of the enclosed characters. For instance, `[abc]` will match either `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### Character Classes

Character classes are predefined sequences that match specific sets of characters. For instance, `\d` matches any digit, equivalent to `[0-9]`.

### The OR Operator

The OR operator | is used to specify alternative patterns. In our reference regex, `ABC|DEF` uses the OR operator to match either `ABC` or `DEF`.

### Flags

Flags are used to modify the behavior of the regex. For instance, the `i` flag makes the regex case-insensitive.

### Character Escapes

Character escapes are used to match special characters literally. For instance, `\.` matches a literal period.
